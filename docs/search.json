A lower average population of 3,692 v. 5,429 in the High MOE Tracts under the new criteria indicates that lower population tracts are more at risk for data quality issues. An increase from 47.4% to 66.6% White Population in these high risk tracts also indicates that the tracts with lower populations tend to be predominantly White demographically."

Both counties and tracts that contained lower populations were more likely to have higher margins of error.\n\nEquity Assessment: Which communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias based on your findings?\n\nThis analysis showed that these rural communities face the largest risk of misrepresentation when employing algorithmic decision making.

Any analysis based on census data must account for these factors or they risk harming underrepresented communities. Under reporting or over reporting of information is cause for inaccuracy in algorithmic decision making.\n\nStrategic Recommendations: What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?\n\nThe department should include additional data in its analysis to create a more informed view of their target areas. Special attention should be payed to counties and tracts with a high Margin of Error in Census data. They should also allow for increased allocation of funds to these areas on an as needed basis.

The above Counties have the top 5 margin’s of error within the dataset and very small populations.These are rural counties that are highly likely to need social assistance and state funding due to their lack of municipal resources. Their recorded median incomes are at risk of being misrepresented by a sample population that is more likely to have access to internet and more likely for their incomes to be on record. Poor rural communities tend to be underrepresented in census data due to their remoteness and lack of amenities."

A general trend seems to be that with higher population comes lower margin of error. These high population areas would see less errors from algorithm based service on their behalf. Conversely, potential error in lower population area’s should be compensated for via more enhanced predictive modeling or simply a need based increase in service. A request based funding allotment could be a good stop gap until more accurate information is availible."

A lower average population of 3,692 v. 5,429 in the High MOE Tracts under the new criteria indicates that lower population tracts are more at risk for data quality issues. An increase from 47.4% to 66.6% White Population in these high risk tracts also indicates that the tracts with lower populations tend to be predominantly White demographically."

    "text": "5.1 Analysis Integration and Professional Summary\nExecutive Summary:\nThe chief systematic pattern across all my analysis was the inverse relationship between population and margin of error. Both counties and tracts that contained lower populations were more likely to have higher margins of error.\nThis analysis showed that these rural communities face the largest risk of misrepresentation when employing algorithmic decision making. I would like to increase the scope of the study to examine urban population in more detail to understand which demographics are at higher risk of misrepresentation regardless of population dsensity.\nSystemic factors like poverty, historical oppression, and political and economic conditions all contribute to bias within data sets. Any analysis based on census data must account for these factors or they risk harming underrepresented communities. Under reporting or over reporting of information is cause for inaccuracy in algorithmic decision making.\nThe department should include additional data in its analysis to create a more informed view of their target areas. Special attention should be payed to counties and tracts with a high Margin of Error in Census data. They should also allow for increased allocation of funds to these areas on an as needed basis. I would recommend a hybrid approach of algorithmic decision making and field research to determine resource allocation."
